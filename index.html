Sometimes it can be hard to tell up from down.<br><br> <b>As a leader, you might recognize some of these challenges:</b></p>
				<p>
					<ul> 
						<li>You struggle to stop working “in” the business and start working “on” it.</li>
						<li>You feel like your team (including your senior leaders) isn't as effective as it could be. You’re aware that you somehow get in the way, but unclear how.</li>
						<li>You get overwhelmed and struggle to identify what's most important. You get trapped in procrastination and avoidance. This drives a sense of impostor syndrome—a belief that you’re not “really” a leader, that evenutally you'll be "found out".</li>
						<li>You feel burned out and unfulfilled. Something is off, but you can’t determine what.</li>
						<li>You feel a pervasive sense of loneliness. You believe that no one around you “gets it”.</li>
						<li>You struggle with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. You're unsure if it's normal, what to do with it, or how to process it.</li>
						<li>You struggle to find time to work on yourself.</li>
						<li>You desire a partner to give you feedback and help optimize your leadership. You're high performing, but you know you can be better.</li>

						<p>"Before working with Justin I was deeply skeptical about coaching. I wasn't sure if I'd be happy with the results. Seemed like a bunch of New Age woo-woo.<br><br>

						But then Justin and I spoke, and we immediately connected. He saw leadership and personal growth in a way I hadn't encountered before. In just a few minutes, I knew he could help me tremendously on my path.<br><br>

						Now, I’ve seen and felt the results. <b>Working with Justin has been the best investment I have ever made in myself.</b> I’m more sincere, honest, and clear in how I communicate. I’ve gotten feedback that I’m more present, I tolerate bullshit less, and question things in a startlingly constructive way. I feel and act more like a leader in my work and in my personal life.<br><br>

						Working with Justin isn't for everyone, but for the right person, he's a game changer. I especially recommend you work with Justin if you’re hard working and have achieved a lot, but sense there’s something lurking inside of you that’s holding you back from where you want to be. Get ready to go spelunking in the dark recesses of your heart."<br><br>

						<p>"Justin’s coaching has been invaluable to me and my business. One of the most pivotal aspects

						<b>My Mission:</b> I help Leaders and Leadership teams become more conscious, connected, and effective through  conscious coaching and facilitation.<br><br>
						After receiving an undergraduate degree in Economics and Mathematics from Binghamton University, I spent the first inning of my work life at early stage technology companies. My career kicked off as employee #3 at a <span id="crystal"><a href="https://www.crystalknows.com/" target="_blank">fast-growing tech startup</a></span>. From there, I ran data for a <a href="https://blog.spacious.com/spacious-closes-9m-series-a-to-add-100-locations-retail-flagships-98b4f153c4d6" target="_blank">$9M fundraise</a>, led the product and data side of an <span id="ravti"><a href="https://www.buildingengines.com/company/newsroom/building-engines-acquires-ravti/" target="_blank">acquisition</a></span>, and supported C-level leaders in every department of the modern tech org (including CEOs, CTOs, CROs, CFOs, CPOs, and COOs, but who’s counting?).<br><br>
						It was early on in that journey that I knew I wanted to be a coach. As I developed myself professionally, I fell in love with psychology. I learned that I have a unique ability to see the many ways that leader’s personal dysfunction leaks out into their teams and companies, something that I call <a href="https://justinmulvaney.substack.com/i/45368069/founder-dna-where-culture-comes-from" target="_blank">Founder DNA</a>. I quickly realized that if I could help leaders see all of the ways they get in the way of themselves and their team, it would create more value than all of my other skills combined. Leadership is leverage, after all.<br><br>
						Now, nearly a decade after that initial insight, I’ve worked with 75+ leaders over 1000’s of 1-on-1 sessions, facilitated masterminds, and experiential workshops to do exactly that. The leaders I work with report being able to more adeptly understand and work with their emotions, communicate, and move things forward, as well as having deeper relationships and more satisfaction in their personal and professional lives.<br><br>
						If you’re interested, please do reach out. It would be a delight to meet and work with you.
