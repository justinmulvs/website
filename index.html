				<p>Justin’s coaching has been invaluable to me and my business. One of the most pivotal aspects has been
					Justin’s ability to walk the line of gentle but earnest guidance and encouragement while still
					giving me full ownership of my process. I feel immense pride and accomplishment in all the progress
					that I make with his support as a partner.<br><br>

					In the moments when I’m at a growth edge and it is compounding in rapid succession, it doesn’t
					always feel like growth because inevitably, it’s entirely unfamiliar territory. This can be
					incredibly disorienting, and <b>Justin’s guidance along the edge of it, keeping it in perspective
						along the path, allows me to accelerate so much faster since I’m no longer wasting time and
						energy wondering if I’m moving in the right direction.</b><br><br>

					<b>I can trust Justin’s broader perspective, trust the goals we have set together, and trust that
						all the little moments of uncertainty are actually right where I need to be. It all comes
						together to create more growth in my personal process and business than I have ever experienced
						working alone, or in any other capacity.</b> I cannot possibly recommend working with him highly
					enough.<br><br>

				<p><b>Since I started with Justin about six months ago, my revenue has nearly doubled.</b> He did this
					by expertly helping me remove physical and mental blockers that I didn’t even know I had to make
					room for smart decisions to move my income upward. The best part is, at the same time, <b>he made
						sure my decision-making fundamentally resonated with who I am as a person.</b><br><br>

					Justin sees the moving parts in my personal life as one-and-the-same as the moving parts in my
					business. He constantly helps me address that difficult work-life imbalance often associated with
					being a Solopreneur.<br><br>

					<b>His unique approach beautifully balances psychological and emotional awareness with hard-hitting
						strategy and clarity of direction.</b> When working with Justin, no stone will go unturned no
					matter the shape or size. Yet, he will make this seemingly arduous and overwhelming process of doing
					so unbelievably invigorating, positive, and comfortable.<br><br>

				<p>I've made a career out of supporting world-class entrepreneurs and leaders. I started working at my
					family's business at the age of 12. My first job out of college was employee #3 at a <span

					Those supporting roles led me to my passion for coaching and the decision to become an

					As a coach, I've worked with clients in NYC, Nashville, and Boston. I've helped solopreneurs grow
