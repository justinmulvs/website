Sometimes it can be hard to tell up from down.<br><br> <b>As a leader, you might recognize some of these challenges:</b></p>
				<p>
					<ul> 
						<li>You struggle to stop working “in” the business and start working “on” it.</li>
						<li>You feel like your team (including your senior leaders) isn't as effective as it could be. You’re aware that you somehow get in the way, but unclear how.</li>
						<li>You get overwhelmed and struggle to identify what's most important. You get trapped in procrastination and avoidance. This drives a sense of impostor syndrome—a belief that you’re not “really” a leader, that evenutally you'll be "found out".</li>
						<li>You feel burned out and unfulfilled. Something is off, but you can’t determine what.</li>
						<li>You feel a pervasive sense of loneliness. You believe that no one around you “gets it”.</li>
						<li>You struggle with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. You're unsure if it's normal, what to do with it, or how to process it.</li>
						<li>You struggle to find time to work on yourself.</li>
						<li>You desire a partner to give you feedback and help optimize your leadership. You're high performing, but you know you can be better.</li>

						<p>"Justin has helped me become a better founder & CEO but more importantly he’s made me a better husband, friend, and human being.<br><br>

							They say founding a start-up is like eating glass and honestly, that’s an understatement. I first started looking for a coach because I was suffering from all of the classic “founder issues” - how to be a leader, how to deal with (near constant) failure and how to work with my co-founders. I felt overwhelmed, I felt lost, and I knew without help the company (and maybe my sanity) would not make it.<br><br>

							We interviewed an all-star list of people - youtubers, podcasters, published authors you name it. We chose Justin because he was able to provide the safest, most open, most healing “space” for our conversations.<br><br>

							Justin is able to somehow balance being a coach, therapist and consultant. He gives tough, actionable advice while also providing constant human connection and support. With Justin, you feel safe and challenged at the same time - and that results in growth.<br><br>

							Today, I am a better communicator, leader, and person thanks to Justin. He’s helped me understand my strengths and my "blindspots." I can now better process my emotions and grow my relationships. I am able to push past my old mental blockers. I can finally “get out of my own way.”<br><br>

							So if you’re looking to grow professionally or as a human being, if you feel “stuck” and don’t know what to do - you should work with Justin."<br><br>

						<p>"I had heard great things about Justin before working with him, but I wasn’t sure how his experience would translate to my industry. My biggest surprise in working with him has been just how beneficial his coaching is.<br><br>

						Justin has helped me think outside the box. He’s helped me navigate my personal feelings about my job and managing people. With his help I’ve had hard conversations and navigated tricky situations with my team that I may have avoided otherwise. One of my favorite parts about working with Justin is how he asks hard questions in a way that challenges you but doesn’t make you want to run the other way.<br><br>

						Since working with Justin, I’m more confident as a leader. I’m more confident in saying the hard things that I need to say and knowing how to do that effectively. I’m better at addressing things sooner rather than later, especially confrontation that I might prefer not to face.<br><br>

						I recommend anyone who owns a business or is in a leadership or management role work with Justin. He has expertly helped me with with people management, team building, and cultivating the kind of relationship that I want with my employees."<br><br>

						<p>"Since working with Justin, I’m more conscious about what I’m doing in my business. Before, I was driven by my emotions and feelings. Now I’m able to step back, understand what’s going on, and see everything from a new perspective— to take a 10,000 foot view about what’s going on—and make decisions from there. I can get out of my head and feelings and more clearly see the situation as a whole.<br><br>

						Justin has this unique ability of helping me find the answer by digging deeper into my struggles, rather than giving suggestions or advice. I’ve been surprised by how deeply we’ve gone into me while working together. I expected tactical and actionable tips, but we spend more of our time going deeply into the root cause of my thoughts, emotions, and how I see and operate in the world. Working with Justin, I feel like I’ve opened doorways to new parts or myself. He has this ability to immediately create safety and rapport. I know that I can trust him and talk about whatever I need to talk about.<br><br>

						If you’re a startup founder who’s going through startup rollercoaster, finding yourself struggling to make difficult decisions, or want to stare into the abyss and confront the deepest challenges of leadership and growing your business, I recommend working with Justin."<br><br>

						<p>"Before working with Justin I was deeply skeptical about coaching. I wasn't sure if I'd be happy with the results. Seemed like a bunch of New Age woo-woo.<br><br>

						But then Justin and I spoke, and we immediately connected. He saw leadership and personal growth in a way I hadn't encountered before. In just a few minutes, I knew he could help me tremendously on my path.<br><br>

						Now, I’ve seen and felt the results. Working with Justin has been the best investment I have ever made in myself. I’m more sincere, honest, and clear in how I communicate. I’ve gotten feedback that I’m more present, I tolerate bullshit less, and question things in a startlingly constructive way. I feel and act more like a leader in my work and in my personal life.<br><br>

						Working with Justin isn't for everyone, but for the right person, he's a game changer. I especially recommend you work with Justin if you’re hard working and have achieved a lot, but sense there’s something lurking inside of you that’s holding you back from where you want to be. Get ready to go spelunking in the dark recesses of your heart."<br><br>

						<b>My Mission:</b> I help Leaders and Leadership teams become more conscious, connected, and effective through  conscious coaching and facilitation.<br><br>
						After receiving an undergraduate degree in Economics and Mathematics from Binghamton University, I spent the first inning of my work life at early stage technology companies. My career kicked off as employee #3 at a <span id="crystal"><a href="https://www.crystalknows.com/" target="_blank">fast-growing tech startup</a></span>. From there, I ran data for a <a href="https://blog.spacious.com/spacious-closes-9m-series-a-to-add-100-locations-retail-flagships-98b4f153c4d6" target="_blank">$9M fundraise</a>, led the product and data side of an <span id="ravti"><a href="https://www.buildingengines.com/company/newsroom/building-engines-acquires-ravti/" target="_blank">acquisition</a></span>, and supported C-level leaders in every department of the modern tech org (including CEOs, CTOs, CROs, CFOs, CPOs, and COOs, but who’s counting?).<br><br>
						It was early on in that journey that I knew I wanted to be a coach. As I developed myself professionally, I fell in love with psychology. I learned that I have a unique ability to see the many ways that leader’s personal dysfunction leaks out into their teams and companies, something that I call <a href="https://justinmulvaney.substack.com/i/45368069/founder-dna-where-culture-comes-from" target="_blank">Founder DNA</a>. I quickly realized that if I could help leaders see all of the ways they get in the way of themselves and their team, it would create more value than all of my other skills combined. Leadership is leverage, after all.<br><br>
						Now, nearly a decade after that initial insight, I’ve worked with 100+ leaders over 1000’s of 1-on-1 sessions, facilitated masterminds, and experiential workshops to do exactly that. The leaders I work with report being able to more adeptly understand and work with their emotions, communicate, and move things forward, as well as having deeper relationships and more satisfaction in their personal and professional lives.<br><br>
						If you’re interested, please do reach out. It would be a delight to meet and work with you.
