Working with Justin transformed both how I lead and how I show up in my executive relationships.

When we started, I was grinding 12+ hour days in constant firefighter mode, struggling with perfectionism, and taking everything personally.

Justin created an incredibly safe space where I could be brutally honest about my struggles. Through our work together, I learned to recognize when my inner critic was running the show and quiet it down. Justin helped me shift from "I have to" to "I'm choosing to" and from grinding for external validation to finding genuine enjoyment in my work.

My cofounder and I learned how to shift out of unhelpful relationship dynamics and completely changed how I approach our relationship.

The practical shifts were massive. I learned to celebrate wins instead of just grinding to the next goal. I got much better at giving feedback that helps people grow rather than just being critical. I identified my zone of genius and started protecting time for what actually moved the needle. Most importantly, my cofounder and I successfully transitioned to Co-CEOs with clear lanes of ownership and a much stronger foundation of trust.

Justin's coaching style is direct, insightful, and challenging. He never let me off the hook for taking responsibility, but he also helped me see myself with more compassion. The space he created was unlike anything I'd experienced—I felt safe to share anything, and I consistently came out more thoughtful and intentional about both my life and how I work with others.
