I came to Justin to become a better product manager but ended up growing an immensely as a person. In fact, I’d tried multiple therapists for personal reasons before, but it was actually Justin, through coaching, who helped me understand myself the best.

He’s extremely present and adaptable. Sometimes he gives me the space to talk things through and find my own conclusions, and other times he challenges me with tough questions that make me rethink what I believe. That balance has led to some of my biggest realizations breakthroughs like how to not let little details stress me out and what my core values are.

Justin has also helped me see my default tendencies more clearly, which means I can lean into my strengths when they serve me. He’s trained me to notice and work through discomfort in a way that’s made me better at handling both internal and external conflict.

Justin’s approach makes you look inward but also helps you bring that awareness into the real world. I couldn’t recommend him enough to anyone who is open to growth!
