My work with Justin was transformative to say the least. His intentional approach to understanding how I operate and the deeper why led to conversations that fundamentally reshaped how I handle everyday life challenges, respond to business obstacles, and see myself.

His ability to actively listen and create space for whatever needed attention always produced robust dialogue and actionable insights and reflections for the next session. If you’re looking for someone to help you reframe your relationship with work, achieving lofty goals, and most importantly, sustaining yourself along the way, I couldn’t recommend Justin more.
