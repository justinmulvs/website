Since working with Justin, I'm more conscious about what I'm doing in my business. Before, I was driven by my emotions and feelings. Now I'm able to step back, understand what's going on, and see everything from a new perspective— to take a 10,000 foot view about what's going on—and make decisions from there. I can get out of my head and feelings and more clearly see the situation as a whole.

Justin has this unique ability of helping me find the answer by digging deeper into my struggles, rather than giving suggestions or advice. I've been surprised by how deeply we've gone into me while working together. I expected tactical and actionable tips, but we spend more of our time going deeply into the root cause of my thoughts, emotions, and how I see and operate in the world. Working with Justin, I feel like I've opened doorways to new parts or myself. He has this ability to immediately create safety and rapport. I know that I can trust him and talk about whatever I need to talk about.

If you're a startup founder who's going through the startup rollercoaster, finding yourself struggling to make difficult decisions, or want to stare into the abyss and confront the deepest challenges of leadership and growing your business, I recommend working with Justin.
