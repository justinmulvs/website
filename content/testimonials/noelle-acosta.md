Working with Justin has been truly transformative. He has a rare ability to illuminate the hidden patterns that quietly shape how we show up as leaders. With a blend of compassion and clarity, grounded analysis and deep intuition, he helped me see where long-standing stories were limiting my decisions as a founder.

Justin created a space where I felt safe enough to lean into discomfort, trust my inner guidance, and explore new perspectives that changed not just how I led, but how I related to myself. Through our work together, I learned how to ask for help, to trust my decisions with conviction, and to navigate the highs and lows of building a company with a greater sense of alignment, confidence, and possibility.

His coaching exceeded every expectation I had. It felt human. I’m profoundly grateful for his wisdom, support, and friendship he offered throughout my journey.
