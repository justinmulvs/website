I truly cannot recommend Justin enough. If you’re a leader ready to do the deep emotional work, work that changes not only how you lead, but how you see yourself, Justin is the person you want by your side.

Working with Justin healed parts of me I didn’t even know were hurting. I’ve spent years in therapy and truly believed I had done the work to handle whatever life threw at me, but I never realized how deeply my career was impacting me, or how much I had been avoiding within it.

Justin gently brought those hidden parts to the surface and stood with me as I faced them. He created a space where I felt safe enough to be completely vulnerable, yet he pushed me, with compassion and honesty, in exactly the ways I needed. He helped me name truths I had been afraid to admit, and he gave me the courage to accept them.

In working with Justin, you don’t just confront your uncomfortable parts—you learn to hold them, understand them, and grow from them. And for that I am forever grateful!
