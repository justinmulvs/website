Working with Justin has radically changed how I approach not just my career, but my life.

When I first started working with Justin, I was fixated on trying to “fix” very tactical work problems in front of me. But very quickly, Justin helped me realize that the real work lay in more fundamental explorations around my emotions, thoughts, and the narratives I was unconsciously telling myself that influenced how I moved through life. Justin’s superpower is the ability to deeply see and empathize with you - while asking the hard and incredibly perceptive questions. Nearly every session, I came away with a “lightbulb” moment that made me see something differently. And above all, I’ve come to realize and deeply appreciate that the work Justin and I did together was not just toward a temporary goal like solving a discrete work problem or making a single next step career decision - but to help me get in touch with, deeply understand, and move in alignment with what I really want. That is a lifelong muscle that I can exercise for years to come, and a journey that I’m thankful Justin helped set me on.

Throughout our work, I appreciated Justin’s structured but flexible approach. I felt like a co-creator in the coaching experience, and found it enormously beneficial to draw from Justin’s expansive knowledge base of frameworks, exercises, and modes (ranging from enneagram to parts work) while tailoring our sessions to what I needed in the moment. Above all, I’ve appreciated how much genuine care Justin brings to each and every interaction. I’ve felt seen yet accountable, safe yet challenged, in every session together.

If you are feeling stuck, restless, or out of touch with what you want - 10000%, work with Justin! He’s the best partner I could have asked for in navigating a tumultuous chapter of my life - with him I was able to take a deep breath, dive into the depths of myself, and resurface with a much better understanding of my authentic self and how to move through life with greater intention and alignment.
