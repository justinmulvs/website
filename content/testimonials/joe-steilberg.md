Working with Justin helped me level up as a founder.

Before we started, I was just a guy running a startup without really knowing what it meant to lead - setting expectations, holding people accountable, having the confidence to trust my gut. Not having the inner skills or experience to work through those things had me operating “below the line” (something Justin helped me see), which was draining the shit out of me and killing momentum for my startup.

Over two-plus years, Justin helped me find my footing in chaos and speak from truth. He guided me through some incredibly hard things: co-founder split, holding employees accountable, board dynamics, and helped me acknowledge the fear in what I was doing instead of ignoring it.

What makes Justin special is his ability to be empathetic while teaching presence and providing the right amount of challenge. He saw me, supported me, and then pushed me - in the best way.

Being a founder can be hard and lonely. With Justin, it gets easier and less lonely. Help yourself roll a 20 and work with Justin - I highly recommend it.
