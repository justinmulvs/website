Justin is a shaman dressed as a leadership coach. He has helped me to see that things I wouldn't expect connect in important and meaningful ways. He's illuminated how many of the stories I was telling myself were just that: stories, designed to protect me from something else. As a founder, it is shocking how many "business problems" actually stem from these (almost all of them!).

Justin is very skilled at straddling the yin and yang of: structured vs organic; goal-oriented vs understanding-oriented; analytical vs intuitive; intellectual vs felt-experience. Working with him has exceeded my expectations by 100x. Highly recommend working with him if you are ready to open up your heart to the inner work.
