Justin has helped me become a better founder & CEO but more importantly he's made me a better husband, friend, and human being.

They say founding a start-up is like eating glass and honestly, that's an understatement. I first started looking for a coach because I was suffering from all of the classic "founder issues" - how to be a leader, how to deal with (near constant) failure and how to work with my co-founders. I felt overwhelmed, I felt lost, and I knew without help the company (and maybe my sanity) would not make it.

We interviewed an all-star list of people - youtubers, podcasters, published authors you name it. We chose Justin because he was able to provide the safest, most open, most healing "space" for our conversations.

Justin is able to somehow balance being a coach, therapist and consultant. He gives tough, actionable advice while also providing constant human connection and support. With Justin, you feel safe and challenged at the same time - and that results in growth.

Today, I am a better communicator, leader, and person thanks to Justin. He's helped me understand my strengths and my "blindspots." I can now better process my emotions and grow my relationships. I am able to push past my old mental blockers. I can finally "get out of my own way."

So if you're looking to grow professionally or as a human being, if you feel "stuck" and don't know what to do - you should work with Justin.
