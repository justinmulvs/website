I had heard great things about Justin before working with him, but I wasn't sure how his experience would translate to my industry. My biggest surprise in working with him has been just how beneficial his coaching is.

Justin has helped me think outside the box. He's helped me navigate my personal feelings about my job and managing people. With his help I've had hard conversations and navigated tricky situations with my team that I may have avoided otherwise. One of my favorite parts about working with Justin is how he asks hard questions in a way that challenges you but doesn't make you want to run the other way.

Since working with Justin, I'm more confident as a leader. I'm more confident in saying the hard things that I need to say and knowing how to do that effectively. I'm better at addressing things sooner rather than later, especially confrontation that I might prefer not to face.

I recommend anyone who owns a business or is in a leadership or management role work with Justin. He has expertly helped me with with people management, team building, and cultivating the kind of relationship that I want with my employees.
