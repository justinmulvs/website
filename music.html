		<p>While I never actually played in Early Bird (well, aside from an improptu performance where I was invited on stage to drum to a song I had <i>never</i> played before), it was one of the most ambitious musical projects I've worked on to date. As project manager of their <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/early-bird-s-first-album#/"><b>Indiegogo Campaign</b></a>, I raised nearly $3,000 for their debut album- no, not a teasure trove of cash, but for a small band from Syracuse, NY it was a lot. Check out their campaign video that I directed, shot, and produced or the final cut of the album!</p>

		<p>What started as a college rock band playing for drunk dancers at parties quickly became one of the most mature musical projects I'd ever played in. The journey included kickstarting and self-producing an album, winning $1,000 and free recording time at a NYS collegiate battle of the bands and a hell of a lot of fun in the process. I acted as drummer, producer, and even did some mixing and mastering on a live EP at the end. If you want to hear the single we made with the recording time we won, hit play below.</p>

		<p>Justin&Jesse was my initial foray into video work, starting with a horribly done cover filmed exlusively on iPhones (and no, we didn't know how to use them). That being said, the project was constantly evolving- we made some videos that I will forever be proud of and some memories I won't soon forget. I've included my two favorites here.</p>
